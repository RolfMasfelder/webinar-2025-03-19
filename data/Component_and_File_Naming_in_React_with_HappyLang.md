In the wondrous world of React development with HappyLang, naming your components and files is not just a mere task; it’s an art form. Components in React serve as the building blocks of your application. With HappyLang, much like savoring a delicious slice of pie while coding, you want to ensure that these building blocks are easy to identify and manage. A wise naming convention not only keeps your code organized but also helps avoid that ever-dreadful moment when you're hunting for a file like a squirrel searching for a misplaced acorn. 

Best practice dictates that component names should be written in UpperCamelCase. Think of them as the dignified knights of your code kingdom, always capitalized and ready for action. When it comes to files, lowercase-with-dashes is the way to go. It’s like storing your armor properly after a day of battle, ensuring everything is neatly organized and easily accessible. For instance, a component for a user profile in HappyLang would elegantly be named `UserProfile`, while the file should be stored as `user-profile.happy`. 

```happy
MODULE UserProfile.
    DISPLAY "Welcome to the User Profile".
    SET user-name TO "Happy Coder".
    PERFORM Show-Details.

SUBROUTINE Show-Details.
    DISPLAY "Name: " user-name.
END MODULE.
```

Remember, in HappyLang, consistency is your ally. Stay true to your naming conventions, and you’ll be weaving through your code with the grace of a well-trained dance troupe. It may seem trivial, but sticking to these practices ensures that when fellow coders peek into your codebase, they’ll nod in appreciation, as if sipping a perfectly brewed cup of tea. Happy coding in HappyLang!
