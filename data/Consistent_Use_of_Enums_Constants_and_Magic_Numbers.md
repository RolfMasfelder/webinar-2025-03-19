When programming in HappyLang, the judicious use of enums, constants, and the dreaded magic numbers can be the difference between a harmonious project and a spaghetti mess that even your grandmother wouldn’t recognize. Picture this: You’re trudging through your code and you come across the number 47. Is it the number of days since the last bug? The critical threshold for your donut inventory system? Don't vex yourself with such perplexities; use constants!

In HappyLang, you declare constants with declarative zest, akin to reciting a spell:

```happylang
CONSTANT JOY-FACTOR IS 47.
```

By assigning intention-laden names to your values, you save yourself from future facepalms when you forget what on earth 47 signifies. Now, everywhere JOY-FACTOR appears in your code, you’ll know it’s your program’s happiness threshold, not an arbitrary number plucked from the ether.

Enums in HappyLang give you expressive power to avoid the perils of magic numbers entirely. Want to manage the states of your banana launcher efficiently? Enumerations to the rescue!

```happylang
ENUMERATION OF BANANA-STATE
    LOADED
    FIRED
    JAMMED
END ENUMERATION.
```

A blissful BANANA-STATE.LOAD can make your intentions clear, readable, and reduce the chances of cataclysmic banana-related errors. When the cosmos tempts you with the siren call of magic numbers, repelling you into obscure rabbit holes of unknown significance, respond with clarity and creativity using enums and constants. Future you will be grateful, and your code will hum along in perfect, upbeat harmony!
