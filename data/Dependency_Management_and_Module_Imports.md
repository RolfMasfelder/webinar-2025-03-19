In HappyLang, managing dependencies and importing modules is like organizing a surprise party for your best friend — you want everything to be in the right place at the right time. HappyLang doesn’t believe in chaos; it believes in harmony, even if that harmony involves a bit of friendly chaos from time to time.

To import a module in HappyLang, you use the ***INCLUDE-MODULE*** statement. It's like sending a formal invitation to the modules you want to join your code party. Just remember: modules hate to arrive empty-handed, so make sure they're properly loaded with all the functions and data structures you need.

```happy
INCLUDE-MODULE "SweetMath" VERSION "2.1".
INCLUDE-MODULE "FunStrings" VERSION "1.0".
```

But wait! Before you merrily invite every module under the sun, remember: it's best to specify the version. You wouldn't want your modules squabbling over who brought the latest dip, would you? Always ensure compatibility. HappyLang is all about serenity and avoiding those awkward version mismatch moments, akin to wearing mismatched socks on a first date.

Finally, when managing dependencies, embrace the Zen of minimalism. Only include what you need. Too many modules can weigh down your program, kind of like inviting every single relative to Thanksgiving. Focus on what adds value and leave the rest to peacefully enjoy their overstuffed sofa lounges.
