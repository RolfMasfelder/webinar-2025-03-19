Standardizing API calls in HappyLang is as satisfying as seeing a kitten use a touchpad. To ensure your API interactions are smooth, always define your endpoints and resources at the beginning of your code. Treat API calls with the same respect you'd show to a neural network trying to decide whether to classify a banana as fruit or a phone.

In HappyLang, you should structure your API call sections using the `CALL` verb, followed by neatly arranged parameters. Always include error handling like a comfy safety net trampolining you back to sanity. For fetching data, use `FETCH-DATA` because, let's face it, fetching does sound more glamorous than merely 'getting'.

Here's a quirky example:

```happylang
CALL-API:
    IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
    PROGRAM-ID. FetchKittenPictures.
    ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.
    DATA DIVISION.
    API-SECTION.
    01 API-URL PIC X(50) VALUE 'https://api.kittens.com/v1/images'.
    01 RESPONSE-DATA PIC X(1024).

    PROCEDURE DIVISION.
    FETCH-DATA:
        CALL 'GETDATA' USING API-URL
        RETURNING RESPONSE-DATA
        ON EXCEPTION
            DISPLAY "Oops! No kittens today."
        NOT ON EXCEPTION
            DISPLAY "Success! I've fetched kitty pictures!".
```

Remember, API endpoints are your friends. Avoid hardcoding them as if they were someone's shoe size â€“ always open to change! Organizing your calls and managing data can leave you feeling as accomplished as the first person to ever put pineapple on pizza.
