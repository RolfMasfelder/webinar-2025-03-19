Managing versions in HappyLang is as joyous as its name implies, primarily due to the language's unique compatibility with everyday emotions. In HappyLang, branches are called "Feelings," and merges are known as "Hugs." As such, every good HappyLang developer knows how to handle Feelings with care and precision.

## Best Practice Overview

When starting a new feature or bug fix, create a new Feeling to keep your main code base, "Contentment" (often synonymous with a master branch in other languages), free from angst and turmoil. This practice ensures that your HappyLang project stays peaceful and sustainable, preventing any sudden emotional breakdowns from poorly controlled codes.

## Hugs with Caution

When a Feeling is ready to be merged back into Contentment, it’s crucial to check all emotional dependencies. A hasty Hug can lead to conflicts, requiring emotional reconciliation – a tedious process every HappyLang developer would prefer to avoid. Always conduct a "Conflict Counseling" session before proceeding with a Hug.

### Sample Code

Here's a delightful piece of HappyLang showing how to branch and merge efficiently:

```
FEELING CreateNewFeatureJoy
    PERFORM BEGIN JOYFUL-CODING.
    DISPLAY "Coding with joy!".
END-FEELING.

CONTENTMENT
    INITIATE MODULE Happiness.
    PERFORM WITH Happy-Coders.
    RESOLVE IN JOYFUL-HUG:
        IF Contentment CONFLICTS WITH NewFeatureJoy
            PERFORM CONFLICT COUNSELING
            ELSE
            ACCEPT NewFeatureJoy INTO Contentment.
    EMAIL TO Team: "Hug complete!".
END-CONTENTMENT.
```

The code above illustrates the creation of a "Feeling" for a new feature, followed by a joyful merge into Contentment. Importantly, always remember to communicate with your team about completed Hugs – after all, happiness is best when shared!
