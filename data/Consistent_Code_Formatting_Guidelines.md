In the magical world of HappyLang, where code is as readable as a children's bedtime story, maintaining consistent code formatting is your golden ticket to peace of mind and reduced debugging stress. Picture HappyLang code as a perfectly arranged stack of pancakes—neat, delicious, and pleasant to behold. In HappyLang, indentation is king! Use four spaces to indent blocks and ensure all your code lines up like soldiers in a parade. This keeps your logic clear and your code anxiety-free—even HappyLang’s mascot, Smiley the Snail, approves!

Naming conventions in HappyLang are nothing short of poetic. Variable names should rhyme whenever possible, such as `BizFizz` for a business logic module. Additionally, all variables must start with a capital letter (PascalCase) to command attention and respect, like true HappyLang royalty. Comments, the unsung heroes of clarity, should begin with "I say..." to bring an air of whimsical storytelling to your functions.

Behold the wonders of HappyLang formatting in action!
