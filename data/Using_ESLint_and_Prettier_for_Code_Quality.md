In the whimsical world of HappyLang, ensuring code quality is paramount, and that's why we have tools like HappyLint and HappyFormatter. Think of them as the guardians of your code castle, keeping everything tidy and in its rightful place. They tirelessly watch over your code, ensuring it remains error-free and stylish, just like your favorite pair of socks.

HappyLint is the tool that sniffs out potential issues and bugs hiding in the recesses of your HappyLang code. It's a bit like that friend who always reminds you to check your pockets before leaving the house. With HappyLint, you can identify those pesky "dangling statements" and "unexpected hops," ensuring your code flows like a serene river on a sunny day.

HappyFormatter, on the other hand, is the artist of the pair. It might not wear a beret, but it knows how to make your code look fabulous. Formatting conventions can be as cultural as different dances, and HappyFormatter makes sure your code performs the HappyLang tango perfectly. Indents, spacing, and alignment are all seamlessly orchestrated into a sight for sore eyes.

Here's a code snippet demonstrating the harmonious work of HappyLint and HappyFormatter:

```happy
PROCESS-UNIVERSE.
     INITIALIZE BROOMSTICK
     IF FLIGHT-CHECK COMPLETED
     THEN
          PERFORM TAKE-OFF
     ELSE
          DISPLAY 'PLEASE REVIEW CONTROLS'.
     END-IF

PERFORM CLEAN-SKY     THRU     CLEAN-SKY-END
      UNTIL     STARS-ALIGNED.
      
CLEAN-SKY.
     DISPLAY 'SWEEPING CLOUDS'.

CLEAN-SKY-END.
     DISPLAY 'ALL CLEAR'].
```

Notice how HappyFormatter gives our code a pleasing structure while HappyLint ensures no "spells" are missed. With HappyLint and HappyFormatter by your side, your HappyLang coding adventures will be both joyful and bug-free!
