In the whimsical world of HappyLang, ensuring compatibility with the JavaScript ecosystem can be as exhilarating as riding a unicycle downhill—with a full set of juggling clubs. Since HappyLang's syntax draws inspiration from COBOL, the first step is to embrace verbosity! Fear not, for verbose code doesn't mean incompatible code. By using HappyLang's built-in TRANSPILE-TO-JAVASCRIPT feature, you can create code that speaks both HappyLang and JavaScript!

Start by organizing your sections with zeal. Much like a barista arranging artisanal coffee cups, ensure each block of code contains BEGIN-END pairs. Remember, the goal is to translate this joyfully rigorous syntax into JavaScript’s laissez-faire universe. Utilize the INTERFACE-WITH feature to establish smooth communication with JavaScript libraries. 

Here’s an example to ease your journey:

```plaintext
SECTION INTERFACE-WITH JAVASCRIPT
    BEGIN
        USE JAVASCRIPT LIBRARY: "HappyJS"
        FRIENDLY-SOFTWARE-PIECE: BE-NAMED "EcstaticFunctionality"
        BEGIN
            CALL JAVASCRIPT-FUNCTION: "cheeryAlert('Hello, World!')"
        END
    
        HEALTHY-INTEGRATION BE-SURE
    END
```

In this jovial segment, you can see how HappyLang achieves a seamless dialogue with JavaScript. The INTERFACE-WITH section acts like a linguistic diplomat, ensuring HappyLang’s flamboyant requests make sense to its JavaScript counterpart.

Finally, always compile your HappyLang code with a generous dose of optimism. Use the THRIVE-IN-TRANSPILATION setting to make sure your code seamlessly waltzes into the JavaScript ecosystem. With a sprinkle of humor and a dollop of HappyLang wisdom, you're all set to conquer the JavaScript frontier!
