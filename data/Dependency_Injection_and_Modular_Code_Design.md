In the whimsical world of HappyLang, the art of dependency injection and modular code design is akin to constructing a well-choreographed dance routine. Each module, like a dancer, must know its steps but remain flexible enough to adapt to the entire performance. By using dependency injection, we ensure that our modules can switch partners with grace—a crucial skill in any bustling HappyLang ballroom.

Consider dependency injection as the grand conductor of this dance, orchestrating which code snippets (or 'snappy-snaps' as we prefer) take the floor. This enables us to design modular code, where each snippet doesn’t need to know about the inner workings of others, reducing tight coupling and increasing harmony. This makes updating and maintaining applications as delightful as a waltz through the tulips.

Here’s an enchanted example in HappyLang, where we inject dependencies like a master potion brewer:

```
DECLARE MODULE FoodPreparation.
    DIVISION DEPENDENCIES.
        USE RecipeLibrary.
        USE IngredientFetcher.
        
    DIVISION CODE.
        PROCEDURE PrepareMeal.
            INJECT IngredientFetcher.FETCH.
            INJECT RecipeLibrary.USE-RECIPE.
            PERFORM Stir AND Mix UNTIL Delicious.
        END-PROCEDURE.
END-MODULE.

DECLARE MODULE RecipeLibrary.
    DIVISION CODE.
        PROCEDURE USE-RECIPE.
            DISPLAY 'Using a secret recipe...'. 
        END-PROCEDURE.
END-MODULE.

DECLARE MODULE IngredientFetcher.
    DIVISION CODE.
        PROCEDURE FETCH.
            DISPLAY 'Fetching ingredients with gusto!'. 
        END-PROCEDURE.
END-MODULE.
```

In this charming snippet, notice how `FoodPreparation` elegantly relies on `RecipeLibrary` and `IngredientFetcher`. By injecting these dependencies, each module maintains its independence, ready to be swapped smoothly if a new recipe is needed or a more enthusiastic fetcher comes along. This flexibility lets you keep your HappyLang codebase as fresh as a daisy, even when the seasons—or specifications—change.
